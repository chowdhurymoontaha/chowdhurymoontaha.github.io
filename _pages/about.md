Hi,there! 

<p style="text-align:justify">I am Moontaha Nishat Chowdhury, a <a href="https://www.aust.edu/cse/faculty_member/ms_moontaha_nishat_chowdhury">Lecturer</a> of Computer Science and Engineering, at <a href="https://aust.edu/">Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology</a>. I obtained my Bachelor of Science in CSE from <a href="https://aust.edu/">Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology</a>. My research interest includes: Machine Learning, Human Computer Interaction, Data Science, Pattern Recognition. <br/> <br/>
I am enthusiastic about exploring how advanced machine learning techniques can be applied to enhance user experiences and interactions with technology. Through data-driven insights and pattern recognition, I aim to create innovative solutions that bridge the gap between humans and machines. By leveraging the power of Machine Learning and Data Science, I aim to develop intelligent systems that can understand and adapt to human behaviors and preferences. Through the lens of Pattern Recognition, I seek to uncover hidden insights within complex datasets, enhancing our understanding of user interactions and enabling the design of more personalized and impactful technologies.
<br/><br/>
Previously, I have analyzed Human Activity and Mobility through embedded smartphone sensor data, using machine learning techniques, and found meaningful insights and patterns from that data, which can be used as a metric for various real-time applications like Production Recommendation systems, Healthcare sectors.<b> For additional information, please see my <a href="https://chowdhurymoontaha.github.io//publications/">publications</a>.</b>

## Research
<p style="text-align:justify">My research focuses on privacy-preserving computation, particularly using fully homomorphic encryption to enable secure machine learning on encrypted data. I work on developing efficient algorithms that can handle the computational and communication challenges inherent in encrypted domain processing. <br/> <br/>
Previously, I worked on smartphone sensor data analysis and recommendation systems. This experience with data-intensive applications led me to privacy challenges in machine learning, where sensitive user information needs protection while maintaining system functionality.
<br/><br/>
I am currently developing an FHE Transformer framework that extends privacy-preserving capabilities to modern deep learning architectures.
