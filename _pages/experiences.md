## Job Experiences
<p style="text-align:justify">During my journey as a Lecturer in CSE, I conducted various core Computer Science courses and served on the curriculum committee of our institute, specifically in the OBE (Outcome Based Education) team. Each semester I worked as an Academic Advisor for approximately 50 students.
