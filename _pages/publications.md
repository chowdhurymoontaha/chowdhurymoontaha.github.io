			In today's data-driven world, recommendation systems personalize user experiences across industries but rely on sensitive data, raising privacy concerns. Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) can secure these systems, but a significant challenge in applying FHE to recommendation systems is efficiently handling the inherently large and sparse user-item rating matrices. FHE operations are computationally intensive, and naively processing various sparse matrices in recommendation systems would be prohibitively expensive. Additionally, the communication overhead between parties remains a critical concern in encrypted domains. We propose a novel approach combining Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) representation with FHE-based matrix factorization that efficiently handles matrix sparsity in the encrypted domain while minimizing communication costs. Our experimental results demonstrate high recommendation accuracy with encrypted data while achieving the lowest communication costs, effectively preserving user privacy.

			Human Activity-based studies have become an omnipresent 
research topic in Machine Learning. Considering the countless impacts of human 
activity on persons' everyday life, we have analyzed the correlation between 
human activity and their product preferences in our study and proposed that 
daily human activity could be a metric for product recommendation models. 
To address this previously unaccounted phenomenon, a new approach is pre
sented in our study that gives real-time recommendations to users by observing 
their activeness in daily life. However, product recommendation systems mostly 
believe in ratings, and the purchase behavior of users instead of investigating the 
precious insights of users' daily activities. But we examined smartphones' GPS 
sensor data using machine learning algorithms to urge insights from users' daily 
activeness and proposed a model for predicting the product of interest of the 
purchasers, based on the activeness of their daily life. Moreover, based on our 
model, we have introduced a prototype of a real-time recommendation system, 
especially for the retail shops that rely on users' implicit data from smartphone 
sensors to form product recommendations. For conducting our study, we devel
oped an android application that-collects embedded smartphone sensor data 
and can detect objects to provide product recommendations and product details. 
Experiment shows, that our proffered daily activeness-based recommendation 
system using smartphone sensor data, performs with a precision of 66%, but 
it is also a promising performance because it does not use customers' explicit 
feedback.

			The proliferation of smartphones has become a 
ubiquitous platform for acquiring and analyzing data. 
Smartphones' embedded sensors have become an effective 
source for human spatial and activity-based analysis. 
Machine Learning (ML) has made significant progress in 
learning features from these raw sensor data with high 
accuracy. However, domain experts, knowing ML, can apply 
machine learning techniques for various aspects. In this 
research, we have introduced-a smartphone sensor data 
collection and analysis platform for people in general who 
have little or no knowledge of machine learning but can avail 
the services of machine learning for their purpose. We have 
built an Android application for collecting sensor data and 
developed an Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) based 
web platform for data pre-processing, visualization, and 
analysis. Spatial analysis has been conducted on our AutoML 
based web application on GPS sensor data. We evaluated the 
most visited places of our app users using clustering 
techniques. The experiment shows that the DBSCAN 
clustering algorithm gives superior performance over K
means clustering for our spatial analysis on GPS sensor data.
